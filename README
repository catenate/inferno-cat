My own additions and changes to Inferno.  These may be no use to you
if you don’t use Inferno, if you don’t need what they do, or if you don’t
like my taste in small tools.

You might incorporate these files into your Inferno installation by
binding the sh-inferno subdirectory to /dis.

	bind -a /github/inferno-cat/sh-inferno /dis
