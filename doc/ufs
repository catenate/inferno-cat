With no parameters, it prints entries from the mount table which
contain "funionfs".

	ufs	# mount | grep funionfs

With only one parameter, it adds a leading 'u', and takes that as the
name of the directory to unmount.

	ufs buildhdf5	# unmounts ./ubuildhdf5

With two or more parameters, it adds a leading 'u' to the first, and
takes that as the name of the union directory to (create and) mount.
The remaining parameters are read-only directories which contribute
to the union directory.

	ufs buildhdf5 hdf5-1.8.7 ext_libs	# mounts union into ./ubuildhdf5

Tested on SL6.2 with the x86_64 RPM of funionfs from this page.
